# Contributing

This website was built for use by Dakota State University's Computer Club. 
The live version is updated by committing changes to this repository and then executing a `git pull`
command in the local repo directory on the web server. Therefore, the master branch is always equal with the live version.

## What you *can* contribute:

1. Typo Fixes
2. Minor Code improvements
3. Fixes to open issues
4. Stars :D

## What you *cannot* contribute:

1. Schedule/information updates (unless you are a club officer)
2. Major functionality changes (hey looksies I wrote a CMS for you UwU)
3. Negativity (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

## Contributing Process

1. Find/Open an issue explaining something that should be fixed/improved upon and why
2. If you feel inclined, fork the repo and work on a solution to that issue
3. Once work is done, open a pull request to merge back here
4. If we like your contribution, it will be merged with the real project

## Other notes:

The main reason we are not looking for major changes like a custom Content Management System (CMS) is because we do not have time to support the code base if it gets too complex.
If you can build something that would allow us to update the site easier without drastically increasing codebase complexity, it may be considered.
